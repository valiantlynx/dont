# dont - forgive my naming skills
this is a simple backend i made.
it connect uses mongo db and spins up a sever that allows rest api and graphql api

there are 2 folders inside the apps folder.

dont and dont-admin

dont is the server and dont-admin is the admin panel

you need to setup and run both of them
follow the readme in each folder
